<p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank">The HyperText Markup <u>Language</u>, or HTML</a></strong> is the standard
markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
 A scripting language's primitives are usually elementary tasks o
 r API calls[clarification needed], and the scripting language al
 lows them to be combined into more programs. Environments that
 can be automated through scripting include application software
 s, text editors, web pages, operating system shells, embedded s
 ystems, and computer games.</p>
